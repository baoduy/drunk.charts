# Gateway API CRDs are installed separately via kubectl in install.sh

# This avoids Helm's 3MB annotation size limit (Gateway API CRDs > 3MB)

#

# Installation happens in two phases:

# 1. kubectl apply -f https://github.com/.../gateway-api/releases/.../standard-install.yaml

# 2. helm upgrade --install --skip-crds ...

#

# This directory is preserved to maintain Helm chart structure.
